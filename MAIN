1.Java
   =>Platform independent(bcoz byte codes Can run on any system regardless of its operation system)
   =>High level language(Easy for humans understanding)
2.Features of Java
=>OOP CONCEPT
=>Platform independent
=>High performance
=>Multi THreaded
3.which version of java is currently used
Java 22 is the latest version of Java.
Features
->Foreign Function & Memory API
->Vector API
4.OOP concept[Objects Oriented Programming System or Structure ]
=>Inheritance
=>Encapsulation
=>Polymorphism
=>Abstraction
=>Interface
5.Data Encapsulation
*It is a concept in OOPS
*Used for combining properties and methods in a single unit.
*It serves Data hiding purpose
6.Polymorphism
the ability of something to have or to be displayed in more than one form
7.Types 
=>Compile time polymorphism(It is a Method Overloading)
=>Run time Polymorphism(Uses inheritance and Interface)
8.Interface:(Each method is public and abstract,but it does not contain any container)
=>An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class.
=>It has static constants and abstract methods.
=>The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. 
=>There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body.
=>It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
9.Constructor:
It is a block of code used to initialize an object.
It has same name as that of the class
It has no return type
Creating an object will call a constructor automatically. 
10.Types:
=>Default Constructor
   Does not take any inputs
   Main purpose is to initialise the instance variables with default values
   Widely used for Object Creation
Instance Variable==>non-static variables which are defined in a class outside any method, constructor or a block.
=>Parameterized Constructor
   Capable of initializing the instance variables with the provided values
   These Constructors take the arguments
11.JDK:(Java Development Kit)
Can compile,document and package and java programs
Contains both JRE and development tools.
12.JVM:(Java Virtual Machine)
An abstract machine that provides a run-time environment that allows programmers to execute java bytecode.
It follows specifiaction,implementation,and runtime instance notations.
